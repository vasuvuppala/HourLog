Netbeans' 'Generate entities from database' utility ignores the cascade options for foreign keys in the database 
and instead uses Cascade.ALL. This is extremely dangerous as it can wipe out most of the database! 

Every time entities are generated, make sure the following steps are done:

1. Replace CascadeType.ALL with {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE} in all entities.
2. Add @Version to entities for which optimistic concurrency control is required (to 'version' field)
