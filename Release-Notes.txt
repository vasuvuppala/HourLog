------------------------------------------------------
Hour Log v1.2.0  Date: 2015-October-29

Summary of Changes from Previous Version:
  - Added Beam Report
  - Added charge and energy for ReA beams
  - Fixed bug that causes reports to fail when a summary is made inactive
  - Connection errors from external services such as Olog are now not shown to the user
  - Fixed 'user in OIC list but not in operators list' bug
  - status of external services is now saved in database.
  - Added External Service status page 
  - Time period to edit entries and back-date entries changed to 2880 minutes
  - Refactored database schema: removed extraneous tables
  - Report results are displayed in a new tab so that they can be bookmarked
  - Refresh period of log entries changed to 60 seconds (from 30) 
  - Approved Experiments are refreshed every hour
  - Experiments and Training cache pages can be manually refreshed
  - Olog service is monitored/pinged periodically
       
Known Defects: 
  - Olog identifies authors by their login/email IDs (not numeric IDs). For some authors, whose login IDs are not kept in the user database,
    it is not possible to get their details. So their first/last names are shown as 'Unknown'.  
  - In Hour Log Operations reports and Experiment Reports, slight discrepancy in UOF breakup (exp and excl) compared to old Hour Log
  - Generating reports for experiments that have not started or do not have any events, gives error
  - In Breakdown reports, discrepancy in breakdowns compared to old Hour Log. However, it matches with the breakdowns in the Operations reports.
  - 'next/previous 9/24 hour' buttons do not get disabled at the end times, in both Log and Notes pages
  - 'next/previous 9/24 hour' buttons in Notes page reset selected logbooks to the Facility Operations Logbook
  - The auto-generated shift log entry is visible only after some time (after next refresh) 
  - In management pages, the delete pop-up shows artefacts from previous validation errors 
  - Trouble Reports links open up Intra Enterprise but do not open the page of the trouble report. This is an issue
    with Trouble Report System. Business IT group is working on solving this issue. It works fine with Firefox (workaround).
  - It is possible to that some Trouble Reports may not get cached and hence not shown in Hour Log (new TRs with incident date more than
    a week in the past). Business IT group has been requested to improve the Trouble Reports API to fix this issue.
  - User Manual page is disabled
  - Charts come up as blanks in prints of reports (due to limitations of the component library).
  - A facility manager can change facility data for all facilities, not just her own
  - On Chrome only, sometimes, a log entry can be edited and saved without making any changes 
  - Summary Report for 1st week of 2003 does not work, as there is no data for that week.

Hour Log v1.0.0  Date: 2015-Mar-02

Summary of Changes from Previous Version:
  - Initial version
  
Known Defects: 
  - While editing a log entry, if the beams/source are modified and the entry is backdated,  the beams/source are 
    switched to the values at the backdated time. The workaround is to backdate first and then edit the 
    beams, or vice-versa.

  - Changes to facility base data (vaults, sources etc) are not immediately visible on other pages due to caching
    of data. To see them immediately, application needs to be restarted.

    with Trouble Report System. Business IT group is working on solving this issue.
